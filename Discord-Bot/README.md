##Setup
- dependencies: Need to install discord.py,need to install pyhton3, When installing if it does not install you may need to do a sudo Update!
- how to get an API token: To get the API token you must first create a bot in discord. Then discord will generate a token for your bot.
- where to put it to work with the code: You will need code to connect to discord through python and git. The code itself should not include the token because you do not want others to see the token because that is not a public token. you will need to create a .env file that includes the token!

##Usage
- What command you can type in your Discord server: The commad the discord server will respnd to is fast food!
- The response that it will gove you is a fast food resturant will a reason you might like it!

##Research
- The only way that the discord bot will work is if you have ran the code otherwise it will turn off
- what can we do to keep it running and working: There are a couple of things you can do to your code. You can insert a time.sleep(0.025), keybord.wait(), These should keep ypur code running on either a timer or a trigger.
